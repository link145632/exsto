Hey, if you want to use Exsto, read this entire file for the common sense boost you will gain.

	1. BEFORE YOU UPDATE!  Delete all old plugins and files.  Chances are if you zip up Exsto to the server, it won't delete some files that I might have.
	2. USE THE RIGHT MYSQL MODULE!  Exsto uses the MySQL OO module, not the old one.  Also, be sure to edit the 'exsto_settings.txt' to enable MySQL.
	3. BEFORE YOU PANIC!  Make sure you didn't do something wrong.  If all else fails, post on the thread.
	4. BEFORE POSTING!  Get the revision number, the branch you are using, and all other information.  If you do not supply the revision and branch, I will not help.
	5. BEFORE SAYING EXSTO SUCKS!  Follow #3; chances are you are doing something wrong.
