# Creating Ranks #

Creating ranks is incredibly easy in Exsto, due to its advanced GUI system that allows server owners to create ranks extremely fast and advanced.  To create a rank, you need to make sure you have superadmin status, or any other rank that contains the "rankeditor" flag.  After you check, open up the menu, either by running _exsto menu_ or _!menu_.

Now you should be in the menu.  Feel free to navigate around the quick menu, or any other provided menu page interfaces.  After you are done, click on the Exsto logo.  A little popup should show, and a list of pages would be on it.  Click on the rank editor slice, and the page should slide over to the rank editor.  From there, you should see various boxes and colored items.  Those are the data required to build a rank.

If you want to edit an existing rank, just click on that rank from the tabs in the little window on the left.  You can edit anything on it in the normal boxes.  Just hit update to save your changes, and the ranks will automatically be updated and ready for use server side.

If you want to create a rank, just click on "Create New" on the tab window on the left.  Just enter the information you want, and select the flags you want.  After that, hit update.  It is that simple, and the rank is set serverside and sent to clients.
